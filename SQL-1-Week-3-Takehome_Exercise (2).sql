# Question 2:
# 2) Show the details of credit cards along with the aggregate transaction amount during holidays  and non holidays. 
/* Solution */
/*Using a if condition to calculate holiday and non holiday amount.
In the first if statement - if the transaction_date is holiday then consider the transaction amount
for the sum else consider it as 0 .

In the second if statement - if the transaction_date is holiday then consider 0 as amt
